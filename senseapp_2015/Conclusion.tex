%//"Work is continuing to develop this protocol.  The next stages are 1) to improve the interference model in testing to a multiple channel interference model; 2) To move the implemenation to real hardware and 3) To allow continual updates on packet loss for each node so that channels can be changed dynamically when interference occurs."

We introduced Multichannel RPL, a channel changes protocol as an extension to the existing RPL with ContikiMAC at the network and application layers. The nature of our protocol that decides/run the decision making to the application layer gives us more opportunity to add the decision complexity - intelligence? and do real time channel checking. Our protocol maintains high reliability during heavily interfered periods where  ContikiMAC showed a low throughput of //////result?.

We are continuing with the work to further develop this protocol. The next stages that we plan to pursue is to improve the interference model that we used in testing to cover multiple channel interference model. Why? Testing close to the real world where interference happen at many channels. We also plan to test our implementation to real hardware and to allow continual updates on packet loss for each node so that channels can be changed dynamically when interference occurs.
