Radio duty cycling mechanisms can be classified into two categories; synchronous and asynchronous systems. A synchronous system is a system that requires a tight time synchronisation between the nodes. It uses time-scheduled communication where the network clock needs to be periodically synchronised in order for the nodes not to drift in time. Asynchronous systems on the other hand, do not require synchronisation but instead is a sender or receiver initiated communication. In asynchronous systems the nodes are able to self-configure without time synchronisation and this can have advantages. There are many studies done in multichannel for both categories. Multichannel synchronous protocols include MC-LMAC \cite{mc-lmac}, Y-MAC \cite{y-mac}, and TSCH \cite{tsch}. Multichannel asynchronous protocols such as EM-MAC \cite{emmac}, MuChMAC \cite{muchmac}, Chrysso \cite{chrysso}, MiCMAC \cite{micmac} and our protocol are independent of time slot and synchronisation. 

%ContikiMAC \cite{contikimac} radio duty cycling mechanism is the default radio duty cycling protocol in Contiki that is responsible for the node wake-ups period. ContikiMAC is a power-saving radio duty cycling protocol. It was proved to be efficient in a single channel \cite{micmac,orpl}.

MiCMAC \cite{micmac} is a ContikiMAC \cite{contikimac} channel hopping variant. ContikiMAC was proved to be efficient in a single channel \cite{micmac,orpl} which was the reason for MiCMAC to be based on it. In MiCMAC, on every wakeup cycle, the channel is periodically switched according to a pseudo-random sequence. Chrysso \cite{chrysso} is a multichannel protocol for data collection applications. The nodes are organised into parent-children groups where each parent-children uses two channels for transmitting and receiving packets. MCRP also uses two separate channels as in Chrysso. In Chrysso, both parent and children nodes can hop to another channel when interference is detected based on the channel switching policies. Chrysso functionality comprises a set of channel switching policies that interface to both the MAC layer and the network layer. 

MiCMAC and Chrysso are fully distributed and allow the nodes to self configure and change to another channel when interference happens. The channels that the protocols can use are fixed to a subset of whitelisted channels. MiCMAC and Chrysso could use all channels, however, they do not have a mechanism for channel quality checking before a channel is chosen. It would be time consuming before it could find the interference free channel. This contrasts with our protocol where we are able to produce real time channel selection decisions by considering all available channels to be used in transmissions without blacklisting any of them. 

In order to maximise the use of multichannel in improving packet delivery, routing topology plays a big role in providing an optimised routing tree to the network that is scalable and energy efficient. There have been many studies on routing protocol such as LEACH \cite{leach}, PEGASIS \cite{pegasis}, CTP \cite{ctp}, and RPL. Recent multichannel protocols such as MiCMAC is compatible with RPL as the routing protocol. Chrysso uses Contiki collect which is a CTP-like data collection protocol in Contiki. Chrysso is restricted to only data collection networks. We choose to use RPL as it is the standard for IPv6 routing in low power and lossy networks.

RPL \cite{winter2012rpl} is a gradient based routing protocol forming any-to-any routing for low power IPv6 networks. The topology is set up based on the routing metric \cite{routingmetrics} such as hop count and expected transmission count (ETX) metrics to calculate the distance of the nodes to the low power border router (LPBR). RPL is a rooted topology where any-to-any traffic is directed towards the root unless the common ancestor is found in which case the traffic is then routed downwards towards the destination. This strategy is used in order to scale large networks by reducing the routing overhead at the cost of increased hop count through common ancestor. By default, RPL uses ETX metric to find the path with the minimum number of transmissions that a node expect to successfully deliver a packet to the destination and switches only if it is less than the current rank to prevent frequent changes \cite{mrhof}. Our protocol makes use of RPL topology formation and improves on the channels of the nodes in the topology.
