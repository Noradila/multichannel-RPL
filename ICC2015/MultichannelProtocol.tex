\section{Multichannel Cross-Layer Routing Protocol}
\label{sec:multichannel}

Please consider the following notes on the design:
- What if the current channel that you are using to communicate channel-switch decision is  too bad that you could not get the message through?
- Channel conditions change rapidly with time. What about the communication time from the central coordinator to the node?

* The authors state that channel quality checking is performed by sending 8
  packets to each neighbor. Apart from the evaluation of this overhead, the
  authors fail to state the inter-packet interval, which (if too short) may
  have an effect on the estimate. Also, the threshold of 7 appears to be quite
  high. What happens if no neighbors meets the threshold (see above examples)?
